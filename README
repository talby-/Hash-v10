Hash-v10 version 0.01
=====================

This provides a perl v5.10 compatible hash.  It is intended as a last
resort for porting stubborn code across the "Hash randomization" feature
in perl v5.18 and above.  It achieves this by embedding a perl v5.10
interpeters HV implementation, and allowing you to tie() specific hashes
back to having earlier hash semantics.
